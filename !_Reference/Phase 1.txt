Project Planning:

Define the specific goals and objectives of Phase 1.
Create a project roadmap and timeline, breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
Determine the technologies and tools you'll use for web development and integration with OpenAI's API.
Web Application Setup:

Choose a web development framework (e.g., Flask, Django, Node.js) and set up your development environment.
Create a basic web application structure with user registration and authentication functionality if needed.
User Interface:

Design a clean and user-friendly interface for the code input and output areas.
Implement a code editor (you can use libraries like Ace Editor or CodeMirror) where users can input their code.
OpenAI API Integration:

Sign up for access to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API if you haven't already.
Set up API authentication and obtain API keys.
Integrate the API into your application to send code snippets for analysis and receive responses.
Code Analysis Logic:

Develop the logic that sends code snippets to the OpenAI API for analysis.
Process and display the responses from ChatGPT in a readable format.
Natural Language Understanding:

Implement a mechanism for users to ask questions about the code.
Send user queries to ChatGPT and display the responses.
Error Detection (Optional):

If you plan to include error detection, implement logic that can identify potential issues in the code and suggest solutions.
Documentation Generation (Optional):

If you want to generate documentation, allow users to request comments or explanations for specific code elements.
User Feedback System:

Create a feedback system where users can rate the accuracy and usefulness of ChatGPT's responses.
Use this feedback to improve the model over time.
Testing and Debugging:

Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it functions correctly and that responses from ChatGPT are accurate.
Debug any issues that arise during testing.
Documentation:

Provide clear documentation for users on how to use the application effectively.
Document the API integration process for future reference.
User Onboarding:

Create onboarding materials or tutorials to help users get started with your application.
Deployment:

Deploy your Phase 1 application to a web server or cloud hosting platform.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Set up monitoring tools to track the performance and usage of your application.
Be prepared to address any issues or bugs that may arise post-launch.
User Outreach:

Promote your Phase 1 application to potential users, gather feedback, and make improvements based on user input.
